The Chairman of the Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce, Mr. V. Vijayasai Reddy presented the one hundred and sixty seventh Report on Demands for Grants of the Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce & Industry for the year 2022-23 to the Rajya Sabha on 22nd March 2022. <br><br>
The Committee considered the Demands for Grants (2022-23) pertaining to the Department of Commerce in its meetings held on 14th and 15th February 2022. It held detailed discussion with the Secretary of the Department on 15th February 2022.

</span>
<h3 style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;color:brown !important;"> </h3>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;line-height:2;text-align:justify !important;">

 
The Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce examines the annual Demands for Grants of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry consisting of two Departments, namely, (i) Department of Commerce; and (ii) Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade.<br><br>
This Report of the Committee deals with the examination of Demands for Grants for the year 2022-23 of the Department of Commerce.<br><br>
 
The Report presents an insight and analysis of the budgetary proposals of Department of Commerce for the financial year of 2022-23, the ways and means for its utilisation, expenditure incurred in previous years as well as financial prudence adopted by the Department in its overall functioning. It further elaborates the implementation of schemes/ programmes of the Department and the adequacy of allocated funds for their proper execution and other financial and functional aspects that need to be improved.

</span>
<h3 style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;color:brown !important;">Budgetary Proposals 	 </h3>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;line-height:2;">

<ul >
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The Committee notes that against the projected requirement of Rs. 7369 crore submitted to the Ministry of Finance, an amount of Rs. 6073 crore has been allocated to the Department in BE 2022-23. A shortfall of Rs. 1296 crore in the total allocation is due to the lowering of budgetary support for the crucial heads of MPEDA, Tea Board, ECGC, TIES, NEIA and Interest Equalisation Scheme. 

</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The deficit in budgetary allocation under such heads would take its toll on the optimal functioning of vital programmes and schemes meant for export promotion. The Committee, therefore, is of the view that an adequate budget would facilitate desirable working of the Department which is essential in providing an impetus to trade activities in the country and it recommends that the Department should be allocated additional funds at the stage of supplementary grants for ensuring its viable functioning and smooth delivery of the projects envisaged.

<h3 style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;color:brown !important;"> Trade Performance in the Year 2021-22 	 </h3>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;line-height:2;">

<ul >
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">

The Committee observes that the trade performance in the COVID-19 years of 2020 and 2021 has yielded a mixed bag of results reflecting both upswings and downturns in its growth trajectory.

</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
Declining trend in export to GDP ratio since 2018-19 is a concerning factor which would be affecting the economy at large. The Committee, therefore, opines that while the surging trend in exports is noteworthy and commendable, it should be buttressed with proactive measures to sustain the growth momentum. It also recommends that every constituent sector of export should be augmented and strengthened in order to economically endure the growth in exports on a long-term basis.
</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The Committee recommends the Department to scrutinise the reasons for the slump in export of crucial sectors of Iron ore, oil seeds, oil meals and tea in 2021-22. Impressive performance of export in recent months which has attained a high growth trajectory has generated an enthusiasm in the trade sector which should be retained by all means. Hence, decline in any sector of export should be dealt with a firm hand. The Committee, therefore, recommends that the Department should identify the infirmities and opt for a more focused approach in increasing market access of the sectors that exhibit a downtrend in exports.

<h3 style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;color:brown !important;">  China Plus One Strategy	 </h3>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;line-height:2;">

<ul >
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
 
The Committee is of the view that India needs to leverage the 'China Plus One Strategy' for becoming an alternative investment destination for major global companies that intend to substitute their China-dependent supply chains.


</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The growing preference of companies located in major economies of Europe and US to shift to other manufacturing bases than China provides a window of opportunity for Indiaâ€™s trade sector which needs to be capitalised. The Committee, therefore, recommends that a policy measure to benefit from the strategy should be devised which should incorporate steps to ensure a business-friendly environment and best-in-class manufacturing infrastructure for the incoming investments.
</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
It further recommends that the Government should endeavour to pursue Free or Preferential Trade Agreements or an interim and mini-trade agreement with countries that seek to invest in India under the 'China Plus One Strategy'.

<h3 style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;color:brown !important;"> Pharmaceutical Export 	 </h3>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;line-height:2;">

<ul >
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">

The Committee notes with admiration the substantial export performance of pharmaceutical sector which surged by 18 per cent in the pandemic year of 2020-21. It also appreciates the escalation in inflows of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) by 200 per cent in 2020-21.

</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
It recommends the Government to undertake measures for enhancing the quality production of drugs and vaccines by taking facilitative steps such as reducing the high import dependency on API and emphasising on intensive R&D as well as exploring the non-traditional markets for boosting the pharmaceutical exports.

</li>

</ul>

<h3 style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;color:brown !important;">  Services Export	 </h3>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;line-height:2;">

<ul >
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">


The Committee notes that the consistent pace of growth in export of services sector characterises its capability in emerging as a major contributing force in augmenting India's overall trade. It feels that being the seventh largest exporter of commercial services, India holds immense opportunities to become a leading global exporter of services in future. Hence, it should be ensured that the trade policies and schemes of the Department that extend support to traders must accord parity to both services and merchandise export.
 

</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The Committee recommends that the Department should take efforts to provide thrust on boosting the export of evolving sectors of IT, ITES, Telecommunications along with the traditional areas of Tourism and Transport. It further opines that the niche areas in globally traded services such as financial services, health care, education, accountancy, and other business services should be identified for promoting their exports.

<h3 style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;color:brown !important;">  Foreign Trade Policy (FTP)	 </h3>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;line-height:2;">

<ul >
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">

The Committee is of the opinion that the forthcoming Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) should be progressive in providing a favourable environment for trade by considering the challenges both at policy and operational levels. It recommends that the anticipated FTP should serve as a catalyst in executing trade facilitative policies with an aim to transform the realm of production into an export engine of growth. The policies and initiatives designed under the new FTP should also be accommodative with the trade scenario being observed in the 'new normal' of COVID-19 pandemic embracing the resilience to withstand the imminent waves of the pandemic. It further recommends that the declared timeframe of 1st April 2022 for launching the new FTP should be scrupulously adhered to for ensuring its timely implementation.

<h3 style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;color:brown !important;"> Foreign Trade Agreements (FTAs) 	 </h3>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;line-height:2;">

<ul >
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">

The Committee is of the view that the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with trading partners would foster favourable access to Indian exports thereby boosting economic output. The signing of FTAs would also be a tacit acknowledgement that India's stance towards 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' or self-reliance is pragmatic which gives weightage to free and fair trade. Strengthening trade ties with partner countries on equitable terms would further promote self-reliance by facilitating exports of Indian manufactured goods.<font color="red" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Committee, therefore, recommends that proposed FTAs should be concluded with the trading partners, as has been done with UAE, in an expeditious manner to reap trade benefits. It further recommends that the provisions of FTAs with partner countries should have an inherent review mechanism for ensuring mid-way course correction for any asymmetries in trade.</font>

The Committee has noted that the Government is likely to advance negotiations for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Bangladesh which would give impetus to trade cooperation in the sectors of defence and pharmaceutical. The Committee hopes that the Government undertakes a prior analysis of the Agreement to examine its advantages and impact on the trade between two countries. It also recommends taking earnest efforts to ensure the timely conclusion of the Agreement.

<h3 style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;color:brown !important;">  Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) Scheme	 </h3>
<br><span style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;line-height:2;">

<ul >
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">

The Committee expresses its disappointment in excluding the significant sectors of pharmaceuticals, iron and steel, organic and inorganic chemicals from the ambit of Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) Scheme owing to budgetary constraints. Being considered as a breakthrough, the WTO compliant Scheme of RoDTEP aims to spur the export competitiveness by neutralising the impact of costs of duties and taxes embedded in production of exportable products.


</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
However, depriving the exporters, especially in the MSME segment of such sectors, from the essentially desired incentives of the RoDTEP scheme would severely dent their sustainability and competitiveness in global markets. Further, on perusal of the remission rates prescribed under RoDTEP Scheme vis-Ã -vis the erstwhile scheme of MEIS, the Committee notes with concern the trimming down of compensation to exporters by a considerable margin. It, therefore, recommends the extension of benefits of RoDTEP Scheme to the sectors of pharmaceuticals, organic and inorganic chemicals, and iron and steel in order to retain their price competitiveness in global markets.

</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The Committee also recommends that a post facto analysis of the notified rates under the RoDTEP Scheme may be undertaken to commensurate with the previous scheme of MEIS. Further, review or revisiting of rates on a periodic basis should be conducted to rationalise the rates as per the export performance of the respective sectors.

</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The Committee notes with concern that the prolonged delay in announcing the rates for RoDTEP Scheme after the withdrawal of MEIS Scheme has led to an escalation in pendency of dues. In absence of any mechanism for reimbursing the taxes, the exporters have been compelled to conjure up their additional working capital to the extent of taxes paid for their shipments but not being refunded. Moreover, the Committee feels that the budgetary grant for clearing the pendency would be inadequate to settle the claims arising from the issuance of MEIS and SEIS scrips in April to November 2021. It, therefore, recommends the Department to expedite the clearances of all dues in MEIS, SEIS and other export incentive schemes to avoid incurring of high costs in export. The Committee further recommends that the Government should be prompt in making suitable budgetary allocation to prevent any backlog in pendency of dues to exporters.

The Committee notes that by leveraging tax incentives and offering a state-of-the-art infrastructure to the investors, the SEZs act as a facilitator of economic growth by stimulating export promotion, employment generation and foreign investments.

</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
Comprising of 81 per cent of MSME units, the SEZs play a pivotal role in integrating the MSME sector into quality manufacturing and exports. However, on observing the distribution of SEZs in the country, the Committee notes the inter-state disparity with major concentration of SEZ activities being located in certain developed States of India. It is also worrisome that merely 268 SEZ units are functioning in the country out of the total number of 358 SEZ units that have been notified so far. 

</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The Committee recommends the Department to emphasize upon the optimum utilisation of the existing and notified SEZs by making them fully operational and addressing the hitches that undermines their performance. It also recommends that an inclusive approach should be adopted by the Government in establishing SEZs in the country wherein the areas of core strength of all States of India should be identified and promoted as avenues with a view to attract investments for establishing SEZ units. It is also noted that no SEZs are functional in the North-eastern Region and therefore sincere endeavours should be made to set up SEZs in the region.

</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The Committee is of the view that in order to provide an edge over domestic tariff areas to attract investments and ensure favourable balance of trade of the country, the SEZ units are benefitted through financial incentives and fiscal relaxations. Hence, the levying of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) and introduction of sunset date would adversely affect the competitive advantages of SEZ units in gaining global investments. This has also been buttressed by the recommendations of the Baba Kalyani Committeeâ€™s Report on functioning of SEZs. The Committee, therefore, recommends that the Government should ensure the continuation of fiscal benefits and extension of sunset clause to retain the competence of SEZ units. It also recommends the Department to examine the prospects of inclusion of SEZs into the ambit of RoDTEP Scheme.

<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The Committee appreciates the fact that a new legislation to replace the extant SEZ Act, 2005 is being brought in to give impetus to the development and growth of SEZs in the country. It, therefore, recommends that the enactment of the new SEZ legislation should be expedited by all means.

The Committee takes cognisance of the reduction in rates of subvention under the Interest Equalisation Scheme following its extension till 31st March 2026 thereby affecting the affordability of loans to exporters. It also takes note of the inadequate budgetary allocation to Scheme in BE 2022-23 which would be insufficient to clear off the outstanding claims to exporters as well as to meet the claims of the current financial year. It feels that the Scheme is highly significant in ameliorating the exporterâ€™s burden to avail costly loans from bank especially when the markets are reeling under the pandemic curbs and facing subdued demands. 

</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The Committee, therefore, recommends the Department take steps for switching over to the previous rates of interest subvention (i.e., 3 and 5 percent per annum) of the Scheme. It also recommends that the allocation should be enhanced at the RE stage in order to ensure timely settlement of the claims of exporters.

The Committee recommends that the Department should take efforts to strengthen DGFT which is essential for effective monitoring and facilitation of trade to achieve desired targets. It also recommends that an adequate allocation should be made to DGFT for bolstering it to devise trade promotion strategies, policies, and programmes. Hence, any additional requirement of funds should be allocated to the Department at RE stage.

The Committee notes with concern the insufficiency of budget that has been allocated for Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) for its effective functioning. The Scheme plays a vital role in supplementing efforts of the States to boost the development of export infrastructure in the country. The Committee, therefore, recommends that the allocation should be enhanced for the Scheme at RE stage to augment the public spending in crucial infrastructure projects to improve the last mile connectivity to export.

The Committee takes note of the progress in export of processed agricultural products which presently occupies a share of 23.20 percent to overall agriculture exports. It is of the view that the food processing sector has all potential to become a foreign exchange earner for the country.

<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The Committee recommends that in order to derive maximum export benefits from the sector, Government should take a proactive stance towards enhancing the quality standards of processed food, increasing its price competitiveness, and adopting measures to deal with Sanitary and Phytosanitary barriers in its export.

The Committee is perplexed to note that the Scheme of Pradhan Mantri Cha Shramik Protsahan Yojana, proposed in the budget speech of FY 2021-22, has not yet seen the light of the day. Despite the fact that the allocation of Rs. 1000 crore has been made for the Scheme which aims to enhance the quality of life of tea workers, especially women labourers, the delay in its execution is unwarranted. The appalling living conditions of tea workers in tea estates of West Bengal and Assam coupled with the problem of low wages is a matter of serious concern which needs immediate redressal. The Committee, therefore, recommends that the Department should make serious efforts to avoid any undue delay in the implementation of the Scheme. It also opines that a High-Level Empowered Committee should be set up by the Government to enquire into the working conditions of tea workers in order to take appropriate measures for their welfare.


</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The Committee is dismayed to note the minimal share of 0.156 per cent of exports from the eight States of North-Eastern Region (NER) which is abysmally low when compared to the total exports from India. It is also worrisome that the marginal trade being conducted is lopsided, wherein a major chunk of the export is from Assam and minuscule trade from the rest of the region. It is perturbing to note that the region is not able to develop as a trade centre despite having huge geographical potentialities and endowments. The Committee, therefore, recommends that a strategy, focusing upon minimising the obstructions in trade ecosystem, mainly the infrastructural and logistical infirmities, should be formulated. This should also be supplemented by establishing strong linkages of the region with mainland traders as well as developing a robust land-based trade across borders which would boost local economies.

</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Old Standard TT', serif;font-weight:300;font-size:18px;color:#000000 !important;margin-bottom:30px !important;text-align:justify;line-height:2;list-style-type:circle;">
The Committee admires the efforts of the Department in stimulating production and trade of agriculture and marine products, tea, coffee, rubber, and spices in the North-East Region. It, however, recommends that rubber and coffee sectors should be given more thrust by exploring their growth potential and prospects in the eight States of NER. The Committee also recommends that since the region provides a natural choice for organic farming due to less usage of chemicals in agri-practices, organic production of tea, spices, fruits, and vegetables should be encouraged. Embracing organic farming in NER by supporting producers and traders in supply chain and improving marketing linkages should also be promoted.

The Committee is of the opinion that an institutional post of Chief Economist (Commerce) as an independent body in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry would provide an objective view and economic analysis of trade for maintaining trade balance and better formulation of trade policies.

The Committee, therefore, recommends that feasibility of creating a Secretary-level post of a Chief Economist (Commerce) in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry should be explored by the Government.
